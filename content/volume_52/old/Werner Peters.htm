<h1>The Corruption of the Human Being</h1>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><strong>◆Werner Peters</strong></h4>
    <span id="TextBody" style="line-height: 16pt">
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes to hear news that a government leader has become corrupt. When we think of the word, corrupt, we automatically think of the worst kinds of corruption. Either the leader has accepted a bribe; perhaps he has had an adulterous affair or maybe he has enabled a criminal to get away with a wicked crime. We do not think of the average human being as corrupt. In fact, many people will say that they believe in the goodness of mankind. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a person tells me that they believe in the goodness of mankind, I will challenge them with the following thought experiment. Please leave your laptop in the backseat of your car, come and park it downtown, and while you go shopping, leave your car doors unlocked. Would you be willing to do that? I have not met anyone who is willing to do that.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps try another theoretical thought-experiment. Imagine that the government announces that for the next 30 days, there will be no laws in effect. People can do whatever their heart  desires. No police will patrol the streets. No laws will be enforced. No one will be charged with any crimes.  What would you do in a situation like that? Would you still believe in the goodness of man? If so, would you leave your doors unlocked at night? Or would you hire a security firm to stand in front of your house with armed weapons to protect your property and family? 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You certainly would not leave your house and family unprotected. Because in your heart you know that chaos will break forth in the city. You don’t believe that man is basically good. You believe that we are all affected by qualities like unchecked ego, greed, lust, envy, jealousy, and self-centredness. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this to be explained? People who do not believe in God will say that we are evolving, and that our bad behaviour is simply left over from our animal nature.  In fact, people whose world view is shaped by Darwinism will not even describe our behaviour in moral terms. Many refuse to even accept that there is such thing as morality.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As people who believe that the Bible is the Word of God and is true in all that it says, it is important that we hold to a biblical anthropology. If God has created us, then it is eminently reasonable to look to God’s Word to see what our Creator says about mankind’s condition.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>It was very good </strong>
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible tells us that when God created the world and everything that was in it, He regarded it all as very good. Adam and Eve were created as perfect human beings. There was no moral deficiency in them. They were perfectly innocent; untouched by sin.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are already deep into the discussion, without having defined certain terms. So that is what we will do first. What do we mean by corruption? What is sin, exactly? And of course, in order to recognize corruption, we need to understand what the opposite of that is.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate the question. Although we did not know this until our oldest daughter was a teenager, she was born without a sense of smell.  Whenever we smelled a flower and reacted with expressions of delight, she would copy us and stick her nose deeply into the blossom and then exclaim how wonderful it smelled; yet she was not sensing anything, and we didn’t know it. It wasn’t until she was about 12 years old that she realized something was wrong. She was on a school bus with other children when they traveled through a long tunnel, and there was a strong smell of sulphur in the tunnel. Sulphur smells like corruption, and everyone complained the bad smell, and she wondered what all the fuss was about.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally we took her to the doctor, and there found out that the nerve responsible for conveying the sense of smell to the brain was not working the way it was supposed to. She had surgery, but it didn’t help.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind has a similar problem. Because we are corrupted, can we truly rely on our own intelligence or rationale to determine our own spiritual state? The problem here is that there must be an absolute definition; one that fits for all time and all places. In other words, what is considered corrupt in Asia should also be corrupt in North America.  And we are spiritually dead; we have no sense of what true spirituality is, although many opinions abound.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For our definitions then, we should look to the Word of God.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I will present a definition of sin, (not my own) and will then show from the Bible how we arrive at that definition.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin is any failure to conform to the moral law of God in act, attitude, or nature.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral law of God is a standard that never changes. Time will not change this definition, nor will geography. God’s commandments do not have an expiry date. God’s commandments are not for any one ethnic group of people. They are for all those who have been created in the image and likeness of God.  
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of God’s commandments have to do with actions that are contrary to God’s nature or moral law. But then we have a command against coveting. To covet something is an attitude.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is a commandment to do with an attitude.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the LORD. Lev 19:18
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we make of all the verses in the Sermon on the Mount that speak against anger, jealousy, selfishness and lust? These are all attitudes; conditions of our thought life that may not have become evident in any outward actions. It is clear though that eventually these attitudes do manifest themselves in sinful actions. So there you have it. It is clear that sin is mankind’s problem. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It gets worse. The Bible says that we were “by nature” children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. What does God mean by referring to humans as ‘children of wrath’?
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apostle Paul writes the following words to the Ephesian Christians.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were dead in the trespasses and sins 2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— 3 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind… (Eph. 2:1-3)
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, God refers to all of mankind as children of wrath. And the phrase ‘children of wrath’ means either children characterized by wrath (anger) or children whose destiny is to suffer God’s wrath. In this context, of course, it refers to the fact that because of our sinful nature, we are destined to suffer the wrath of final judgment by God.  
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin and moral corruption cannot be ignored. It must be judged. But we do not need to despair. There is good news. There is a remedy. We will talk about that at the end of the article.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='image/bwn1.jpg' style='float: left' /><strong>What causes sinfulness to be so bad?</strong>
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin is a very negative term, and we have a strong aversion to anything that doesn’t encourage or support us. Certainly, talk about sin is not very encouraging. Perhaps you hate talking about it though, because sin itself has distorted your understanding of sin. One intriguing aspect of sin is that it distorts truth, and so the way we see things may not be the way things are in reality. Many people think that God views all pleasure as being sinful. People think that God is a stern taskmaster and that Jesus would never have laughed at something funny.   Some people think that heaven is going to be a never ending serious and somber church service! Does that sound appealing to you?  Do you see how sin distorts truth?
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that God is the One who created us with desires for pleasure. In fact, the Bible says, “In your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We will talk about desires and pleasure soon enough, but for now, you need to know that God has destined His children to experience holy pleasures, the likes of which would likely kill us if we were to experience it in these physical bodies. Our hearts could not take it.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But, getting back to talking about sin, I dislike talking about sin myself, in the same way I hate talking about cancer. It’s almost as if talking about it gives it validation, gives it more strength. Yet, every cancer patient that I have ever counseled with and prayed with, develops an obsession about the dreaded disease. They want to KNOW the enemy that has invaded their life, and is potentially destroying them, and they will be the first to read up on the latest developments, the latest diets, the latest medications, the latest treatments and surgical techniques. They want to know their enemy.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional athletes spend a lot of time watching their competition, learning their moves, their typical strategies, their strengths, their weaknesses. Why? So that they can defeat them!
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Generals, when they go to war, study their enemies. They learn everything they can about them. Their strengths, their weaknesses. Why? So that they can defeat them.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians - how well do we know your enemies? Where do your particular weaknesses lie? How seriously do you take this matter of sin? Have you ever had a close look at sin? Or do you stick your head in the sand, because the topic doesn’t make you feel very good?
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the unfortunate qualities of  our evangelical culture is that we want to help God to get people converted. We want to help Him so badly, that we change the message to make it easier for people to come to Christ. We don’t talk much about sin, in the process of conversion anymore. We just give it a quick mention, and ask people to ask God to forgive them of all their sins, and it’s all taken care of. We don’t give the Holy Spirit time to bring conviction upon the heart and conscience. We don’t give people time to think about what they are doing. We ask them to repeat a prayer, and automatically you’re saved!
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And, consequently, we see people in our Christian subculture who attend church faithfully, but whose lives remain unchanged, who have never really repented or agonized over the condition of their soul. These are people who have agreed to the IDEAS of Christianity, who believe things about Jesus, but who have never really trusted Him, personally to be their sin-bearer.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising to learn how little we know about the way in which sin defeats us. It is the greatest influence that stands between me and eternity.  It has the potential of affecting how I spend all of eternity. It threatens to destroy me at every turn. And yet, we do not understand our enemy very well. Have you figured out how to deal with the cancer that lies within your soul? 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are like me, you give it some serious thought once in awhile, but you’ve never really  studied it.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to encourage you to study it. Get to know the nature of sin and temptation. Not for the purpose of making you feel guilty.. but for the purpose of defeating the enemy within, so that you can live a fuller and a freer life for the glory of God. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>We are ALL infected with SIN</strong>
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that things in this life are not the way they ought to be.  In fact, when I was a young child, maybe 9-10 years old, I came upon a theory. I knew deep down, that there was something terribly wrong with the world. Every once in a while, it seemed to me that people were forcing their happiness, that the laughter was an act), and that the joy that they were professing was not real. But I  so much wanted to believe that a better world existed somewhere. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I think this way? Because even as a child, I could see there was something seriously wrong with the world. And there is something wrong with me. And some of us feel<img src='image/bwn2.jpg' style='float: right; height: 329px; width: 460px;' />
    that so acutely, that we either lie to ourselves and capitulate and join the act, or we face the truth and struggle to find a way out. Some people cannot tolerate the despair that they experience and will commit suicide. And others find Jesus Christ who said, “I am the way, the truth and the life.”
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first step is to discover and admit there is a problem.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a universal problem. All humans are infected with sin. The Bible puts it very succinctly: “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.”  It began with Adam and Eve, (by now you know the story) and it is a condition that is passed on to every one of us. From parent to child, from one generation to the next.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In admitting this, though, we are taking a stand that is directly opposed by most of today’s thinkers and influencers. Most of todays leaders believe that our behaviour is simply a matter of education and training. We are a product of our environment, and if we can only find the right educational model, if we can only spend enough money and find the right leaders, or the right programs, we will one day still find Utopia. That’s why many political leaders think the state can do a better job of raising our kids than we can. They really are convinced that they can do it. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is, that SIN is not just a behaviour that can be learned or unlearned. It is a condition of the heart, a condition at the very core of our being, out of which our behaviour  grows. It is as much our nature to sin as it is in the nature of a dog to bark.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t believe this, I invite you to go and work in a daycare centre, or anyplace where toddlers play. Put a 18 month old baby in one corner with a toy, and put another toddler in a different corner with another toy. Inevitably, the one toddler will drop the toy he has, toddle over to the other corner, and grab the toy the other kid has. And soon there will be a screaming match and the mothers will have to come to the rescue.  
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The sin of envy is already deeply rooted in the heart of the baby. Envy wants to deprive someone else of their pleasure.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in a grocery store one day. I watched as a busy Mom said no to her little toddler. Her 3 year old child wanted a certain item off of the shelf. Barely out of diapers, this kid threw herself on the floor and had a screaming fit. Arms and legs were flailing the air. “I want my pleasure now, and I will make life as uncomfortable as I can for you until you give it to me!”
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Greed. Or avarice, as the older writers would put it. There it was, in a child’s heart that was no older than 36 months.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is learned behaviour, can you tell me how they learned this? It isn’t learned behaviour, it is natural to us. As humans, we take to sinful behaviour like ducks take to water. Good behaviour needs to be taught. Sinful behaviour happens naturally.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to babies, we tend to excuse it. Sometimes we even think it’s cute and we treat it as if it’s harmless. In fact, isn’t it true that parents treat their babies as if the sun rises and sets on them. And then for the rest of that child’s life we try to undo that error. Love and compassion and tender hearts will often lead loving parents to do great harm to their children by not correcting them.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In adults, the effects of sin become horrendous. In  fact, we read about its effects in the newspapers every day. It’s not about babies and their toys anymore.	 Adults don’t have literal screaming fits anymore. They buy guns and knives and settle their differences violently. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apostle James says, “What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? 2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.” (James 4:1-2a)
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you will agree then, that sin is more than a just a behaviour that needs correction; it is a condition of the heart that affects everything about our lives. Paul personifies sin and speaks of it as almost having a separate existence in his life: With reference to his own struggle, he says,
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans 7:17  As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans 7:20  Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How does our sin affect God? </strong>
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that God abhors sin is an understatement. Whether we are talking about pride and envy, or anger and lust or gluttony, God abhors it. He absolutely detests it. He hates it to such an extent that he actually hates the person characterized by it. Does that come as a shock to you? God has a righteous hatred for sin and evil and wickedness.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But again, I am afraid that we have a distorted view of why God hates sin. For years, I used to think God hates sin for the effect it has on him, much the same way someone healthy wants to stay away from poison because of the toxic effect it has upon him.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that how it is? Is it because God fears that his heaven will be polluted, that he won’t allow sinners into his heaven?
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that God dwells in absolute holiness, purity and light, and in him, the Bible says, is NO DARKNESS WHATSOEVER.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is absolutely nothing I can do that will affect a change in God’s character at all. I cannot compromise the character of God’s nature or behaviour. I cannot diminish the brightness of the sun by turning off the lights in my house. And I cannot tarnish the character of God by my own sinful character. God remains the same – always unchangeable and holy and pure.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me put it this way. My sinful nature is repelled by His holy and pure nature by virtue of the nature of sinfulness, because at the very root of sinfulness is the statement, “I will be god.”
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Holiness repels sin like light drives out darkness. It’s the way things are because every sin is an attempt to dethrone God.
<br /><br />&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;So what’s so sinful about sin? Why does God treat sin so seriously? </strong>
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only because every sin is an act of rebellion against God, but because sin destroys life the way God meant it to be. Sin is the opposite of what God’s love intends to do. Sin destroys relationships.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible calls the Devil a murderer from the beginning, and a destroyer. Some of you know the anguish and the grief of watching a disease or an addiction destroy someone you love. You grow to hate the agent of destruction with a passion.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;God sees how lust eats away at a man’s soul and destroys it.  
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;God sees how envy poisons all of a woman’s relationships and isolates her from effective community.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;God sees how greed eats away at a man’s heart and despite the growth of the bank account, the heart and soul shrivels away.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sloth is not only an allergy to physical work, but a love affair with oneself to the point where you become incapable of acts of love towards anyone else. You become passive, indifferent and cold.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What about anger?  It’s one of those things that make me feel like a man to vent my anger, but I feel less of a man for having vented it.  Let me illustrate with an example. Imagine I am in a parking lot. There are empty stalls all around me, and my wife says, “Park there”.  I get angry. I give her a lecture on the fact that my glasses are still good, I can see fine, and I don’t need her help. The more biting and exquisite my retort, the more pleasing it is to me… and once I’ve delivered my barrage, I feel like an idiot. Less a man than before. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, THAT’S the effect that ALL of sin has on us. It destroys us from the inside out.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;God hates sin because every sin is an anti-god statement, and yet we need this holy God in order to live as fully human. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And God hates sin, because He loves us and can’t bear that we are destroying ourselves.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You can hear his passion for us in this regard when He cries, through the voice of Isaiah chapt. 1, 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;4  Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;5  Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;6  From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness—only wounds and bruises and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. “
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again in chapter 55 we read,
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1 "Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2  Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labour on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of fare.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon says:
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Proverbs 16:25 .  There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.
<br />
<img src='image/bwn3.jpg' style='float: left' /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is true that we are thoroughly infected by sin. Our hearts have been totally corrupted. But even as a child, I instinctively knew that we were meant for something greater than what we were experiencing. We were meant for something far more than what this world had to offer us. We all have an inkling, a dream, that this isn’t how it was supposed to be. There is a country where legitimate joy and pleasures can be had. Where men are true men and ladies can be the ladies they were meant to be. A land where there is no greed or sinful pride. A land where justice and righteousness are the ruling principles. A land that is characterized by a pure unadulterated love. This is what Jesus referred to as the Kingdom of God. 
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A place where pain no longer exists; a land where there is no more betrayal and disappointment with people. All anguish of soul will be no more. This is the remedy that I spoke of earlier.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By God’s grace, we have the privilege of belonging to that kingdom now, by deciding here and now that that’s what we want. That’s what we were made for. And when you do invite Jesus Christ to live and to rule in your heart, you are asking Him to reverse the effects that sin has already had in your life. That’s repentance. To figuratively or literally fall on your face before God, to plead  for His grace to totally change your life around so that you no longer face the power and the bondage of sin every day when you wake up, but rather you face the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the amazing hope that He brings with him when he enters your life.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, he died for your sin. For your behaviour as well as your condition. In your place. He literally took your place. Sin was killing your spirit. He stepped in between you and your ultimate end result of sin, and took the blow for you. And on that basis, you can have his forgiveness, and his love, and His life. That is why the Scriptures say, “I am come that they might have life, and have it to the full.”  
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Living life abundantly is what we all want. Wholesome relationships is what we all want. Freedom from guilt is what we all want. Living life with a meaningful purpose is what we all want.
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin has robbed us of all of that. The ultimate consequences of sin is destruction and death. But God’s word tells us that the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Please accept his gift today. Put it off no longer. And if you do, would you let the editor of this magazine know? It would be such an encouragement for us to know that these words have penetrated someone’s heart.
