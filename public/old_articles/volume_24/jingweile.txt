献给母亲的诗
◆经纬乐（12岁）
  在创世以先 
  神已将我成型 
  放我在妈妈的身体里 
  孕育出婴孩儿的我。 

  正是这个时辰 
  神为我指定了妈妈 
  看护、保守、疼爱我 
  像大海中灯塔与船只。 

  妈妈喂养着我 
  用爱环绕着我 
  注视着我成长 
  倾注她全部的爱。 

  这是神的本意 
  为我挑选出完美的妈妈 
  妈妈满足了我的需要 
  任何人无法替代。 

  这证明了 
  神掌管着这个世界。 
  为我恩赐妈妈 
  是神全能的计划。 

  神知道妈妈将会照看我 
  妈妈做的必会更多 
  地上最伟大的是妈妈 
  妈妈是神赐给我的礼物。 

  我有时惹妈妈不高兴 
  偶而也不听妈妈的话 
  可妈妈总是用爱 
  挽我回到她的身边。 

  妈妈，我将永远爱你 
  你成为我心中的羡慕 
  无论何时我处在低谷 
  你都会将我高高举起。 

  今天是母亲节 
  我要尽我的全力 
  深情的望着妈妈的眼睛 
  说一声：妈妈，我爱你！ 

   

   Mother's Day 

   By JRJ 

 Before the world was set in place, 
 God had already formed me. 
 He placed me in my mother's womb 
 And there he formed a baby. 

 It was then he had appointed 
 A mother to tend me 
 One to love me, and to care 
 As a lighthouse over a sea 
 She watched me as I grew 

  Installed in loving care 
  She gave me food to eat 
  And lovely things to wear 
  All this was in God's plan 

  He picked the perfect mother 
  That fulfilled all of my needs 
  Unlike any other 

  This proves that God has 
  The world in his hands 
  That placing me with my loving mother 
  Was just one of his mighty plans 

  He knew that she would care for me 
  He knew that she could be 
  The most wonderful mother of all time 
  And she was gracefully given to me! 

  Sometimes we can be bad 
  And not listen to her words 
  But as children make mistakes 
  She could bring us to God's sides 

  But we will always love you 
  And we can always admire 
  How when we were down low 
  That you would lift us higher 

  This mother's day 
  In all that I do 
  Is to look at her in the eye, 
  And say, "Mom, I love you."
